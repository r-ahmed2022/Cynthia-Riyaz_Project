              <strong>Nelson Mandela </strong> was born Rolihlahla Mandela on July 18, 1918, in a rural village in the Transkei region of South Africa.  His name means “troublemaker” in the Xhosa language. A teacher at a Christian mission school later gave him the name Nelson. Mandela rose from a humble village of
              mud huts into a comfortable life as the adopted son of a Tembu chief.
              As a young man, Mandela attended university, but was dismissed because he took part in a student protest,
               his first act of civil rights activism. In the 1940s, Mandela entered into the turbulent world of South African racial politics
               by joining in the liberation movement known as the African National Congress (A.N.C).

            Since the arrival of the Dutch and British colonists in the 1600 and 1700s, black South Africans – and all people of color in South Africa – had steadily been pushed out of power. Racist policies of the European-dominated governments took away their basic human rights. By 1950, Afrikaners (South African whites of Dutch descent) had control of the government and enacted the modern form of apartheid. Under this system, black South Africans could not have a voice in the government, socialize with whites, or travel outside their living area without government approval.
